# Worker Verticle

This example shows the use of `worker verticle`. A word you send with the `HTTP Post` request over the `http://localhost:8080/get/:message` is saved to a text file that's located under `recources` directory.
                                                 
```java
   final Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
        final DeploymentOptions options = new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true)
                .setWorkerPoolSize(DEFAULT_WORKER_POOL_SIZE);
        vertx.deployVerticle(new WorkerVerticle(), options, res -> {
            if (res.succeeded()) {
                log.info("Deployment id is: {} ", res.result());
            } else {
                log.info("Deployment failed!");
            }
        });
```
